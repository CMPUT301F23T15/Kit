## Object-Oriented Analysis
No need to put all the classes in CRC, you need to distinguish between important and non-important things. ItemDisplayFragment, itemSet, ItemDatabase, ItemListFragment, tagDatabase these can be removed or simplified. Details are good. Responsibilities are nicely detailed. Responsibilities shouldn't be like "Show a menu button" => (2/3)
